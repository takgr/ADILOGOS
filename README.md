Merge and clean .ADI files from multiple rig's

Running multiple FT8 instances from multiple rigs, raises the issue of a common logging database.
Since currently WSJT-X does not support any kind of database for logging, just a plain text file, a solution to keep your log files up to date is to concentrate all log files to some place and then distil them and create a new file, containing unique log entries

SCP files from your rig's to merger fs
run the script
SCP files back
